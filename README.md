The Contact Management System allows users to efficiently manage, organize, store, retrieve, update, and delete contact details. It typically includes features such as:

1. **Contact Information Storage**: Users can input details such as name, phone number, email address, and address.

2. **Search Functionality**: The system provides a search feature to quickly locate contacts based on name criteria.

3. **Add, Modify, and Delete Contacts**: Users can add new contacts to the system, modify existing contact details, and delete contacts if necessary.

4. **Sorting and Filtering**: Contacts can be sorted alphabetically.

5. **Data Persistence**: Contact details should be stored persistently, typically file handling is being used, to ensure that the information is retained even after the program is closed and reopened.

6. **Error Handling**: Error Handling is being included.

By a Contact Management System project in C++, users can effectively organize their contacts and streamline communication processes. This project provides a practical application of fundamental C++ concepts such as data structures, file handling, and user input/output handling.
